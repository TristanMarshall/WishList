# WishList
WDI project #2 / WishList

Concept:
Wishlist is a site you go to to make your wishes come true.  It allows you to create a list of 'wants' and 'haves' and the platforms return a hit to the items on your 'want' list, if the attributes you describe matches for an item on the list matches an item from another users 'have' list.  Instead of wasting your time scouring for a specific item, just set up your want list and have it come to you!

Stakeholders = developers & GA instructors
